Cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which acts as a medium of exchange amongst two parties. It is known as crypto-currency because of the utilization of cryptography in securing its transactions. Some examples of cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, LiteCoin, Dash, Ethereum, and Ripple. Bitcoin is currently the most popular. With cryptocurriencies trustless and anonymous transactions become possible since it does not involve any third party - there is no central bank. 

Cryptocurrencies can be exchanged as much smaller divisions than is possible with traditional, or fiat, currency. For example, the smallest amount of Bitcoin that can be exchanged is 0.00000001 BTC, which is also known as one Satoshi.

Some crytocurrencies can be earnt through a process called mining. Using a high-end desktop computer or an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) miners can earn a share of various curriencies through solving mathematical proof-of-work problems that validate transactions. Blockchain, the underlying technology of most cryptocurrencies, ustilises the concept of an irreversible cryptographic hash function which consists of guessing a random number (usually less than a certain value) to solve the problem for transaction validation. These machines possess high processing power to be able to solve these problems. Example ASIC models include: Fast-Hash One or CoinTerra TerraMiner IV. Desktop computers or dedicated minig rigs contain one or many high-end graphics cards (such as the Nivida GTX 1070 or AMD Vega 56) and are also able to solve these hashes effectively. 

Invest in cryptocurrencies is highly speculative with much volitility in the market due to the blockchain technologies still being in their infancy compounded with a glut of inexperienced invstors. They can trade fiat currencies on exchanges such as Binance, Bitrex, or Coinbase. The latest market peek was in January of 2018 with Bitcoin reaching $20,000 USD on some exchanges.
